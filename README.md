## Purpose: 
>
>The purpose of this venture is to introduce and evaluate four machine learning models for the early detection (i.e., prediction) of the most prevalent forms of thyroid disease. The aim objective of the project is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of thyroid disease diagnostics that will ideally lead to faster and reliable detection to better patient outcomes as well as reduced healthcare costs.


## Background:
>
>Thyroid disorders affect the thyroid gland and encompasses multiple conditions that are linked to metabolic rate and other essential bodily functions (American Thyroid Association). It is one of the most common hormone imbalance diseases besides diabetes (Osborn, 2023). An estimation of roughly around 20 million individuals suffers from a thyroid condition in the United States (American Thyroid Association). Looking into the demographics, prevalence in females is observed to be 8x more likely than men as well as over time for ages greater than 60 years (Salem, 2021). High risk individuals are those that have family history, cancer, lupus, diabetes, and other subtle medical conditions (Salem, 2021). 
>
>Thyroid diseases can be categorized into two major types: hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism (Croker et al., 2021). Hypothyroidism is when production of thyroid hormones is under functioning or generally having low T4 hormones accompanied with high TSH (thyroid stimulating hormones) in the blood (Croker et al., 2021). Hyperthyroidism is when there’s over functioning or generally having high T4 and low TSH (Croker et al., 2021). Acquired autoimmune disease is the most common cause of thyroid conditions (American Thyroid Association). For instance, hypothyroidism is usually due to Hashimoto’s disease when autoimmune response targets the thyroid gland and slows down its hormone production (Melish, 1990). It’s reversed with Graves’s disease for hyperthyroidism when antibodies over stimulate the thyroid gland for hormone production (Melish, 1990). Besides the two major types, there are also enlarged nodules that can develop in the thyroid that are usually benign (i.e., goiter, cancer, etc) that affect levels of thyroid hormones as well (Croker et al., 2021).
>
>For treatment, hyperthyroidism medication involves blocking of hormone production such as prescription of antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine pills to damage portion of the gland, and in some rare cases surgical removal (Salem, 2021). For hypothyroidism, it is common to prescribe hormone replacement medication (Salem, 2021). Symptoms of thyroid conditions are non-specific and can be highly similar to other medical conditions (Croker et al., 2021). Identification can often go undetected and so it is essential to develop tools as well as models that can be utilized in correctly diagnosing patients with thyroid conditions based off of the key analyte measurements. 



## Current Situation: 
>
>Medical research bodies such as the University of California, Irvine have created diagnostic models for the target illness, including more advanced models such as Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine (SVM). However, they present conflicting performance measures and present an opportunity for improvement. While the accuracy measures for such models are high, precision measurements are significantly lower. Due to the repercussions that a false positive can have on a patient, precision becomes a key performance measure as opposed to accuracy. Generating accurate predictions is key and highly important for the early detection of thyroid diseases, ultimately impacting the effectiveness of (early) treatment.   


## Expected Conclusion:
>
>It is anticipated that the introduction of the (four) machine learning models will make it easy for individuals to assess their individual risk levels for thyroid disorders. Ultimately, influencing their decision to seek medical attention early. The final (ensemble) model is capable of generating significantly accurate predictions and can group individuals by their risk levels. Additionally, it can recommend courses of action such as, “Very high risk. Consult a doctor” or “Risk level very low. Look out for these symptoms in the future”, for example. From a business viewpoint, these models have the potential to revolutionize thyroid disease detection and with it, greatly profiting the organization. For instance, generating revenue from advertising, controlling pharmaceutical sales for thyroid medication, and obtaining bigger contracts in the future. Human ailments evolve with time and so must our tools to deliver optimal healthcare.
